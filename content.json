      "description": "Is your unrented unit causing anxiety? Who better to relieve your anxiety than a psychologist…but wait…you need an interior decorator.  Funny thing.  I'm a psychologist who fell in love with the process of transformation.  Typical psychologist!   Transforming unfurnished units into model homes became so much fun.  But the true magic was elevating the spaces without the outrageous price tags.  Nerdy psychologists enjoy research.  I personally research every item to ensure quality and price.  Overpaying is not an option.  \"It only looks expensive.\"  Every unit I've decorated has rented faster and at a higher rate.  Imagine a modern, turnkey unit completed by someone else who is not you.  Furniture ordered, delivered, and accepted. All of the décor and essentials come from Amazon for convenience.  Your place ready to go without lifting a finger.  When your return on investment increases, you won't need money for therapy.  Decorating your unit will be a lot less expensive than getting psychological treatment."
